===============================

This game is a clone of the classic arcade game known as "Frogger." 

To begin, simply load the index.html file in any modern web browser. The game will load immediately and you will be ready to go! 

Once the game has started, the premise is pretty simple; Just use the arrow keys to guide your sprite through the bug traffic. Getting hit by a bug will send your character back to the start, so be careful! The goal is to make it to the water, which will also send your character back to the beginning. Due to time constraints, I did not put a scoring system in, but I will eventually return and add it.
